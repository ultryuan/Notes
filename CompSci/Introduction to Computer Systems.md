# RANDOM STUFF
Handle complexity in computing systems with an __abstraction hiearchy__. Brake down the big problem into many little ones. Solve the little ones and then solve the next one in term of previous one.

Simple gates for processing signals:
* AND
* OR
* NOT
* XOR
* NAND
* etc

How represent operations and how to represent data?
